Tower Defense
-------------

- Come to CodeCamp and build the best Tower Defense you can.

Basic activities
- Download and unpack the starter kit.
- Run the game from tower_game.py.
- Configure the list of available tower types,
  located in tower_configuration.py.
- Configure the tower colors in tower_configuration.py.
- Configure the baddie spawn rate in tower_configuration.py.

Map activities
- The game loads the file map1.txt.  If you create
  a new map, then you need to rename it to map1.txt.
- The map is a text file, you can just edit a copy
  of the file to create a new one.
- Or, you can create a map with the map_editor program.
  It reads the file map1.txt as input.  If you save,
  it will create a new file named map2.txt.

  Control-c will clear the map.
  Control-s will save the map to map2.txt.

  The middle or right mouse buttons will clear a map
  location.

  The left mouse button will set a map location to be
  a part of the path.  Paths have direction to steer
  the Baddies.  Be sure to hold down the arrow keys
  while drawing the path.  The start of a path must be
  at an edge of the map.  The end of a path must be
  at an edge of the map.
